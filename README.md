HNG7 Internship Project

Hello World!

This is my first time using Git and GitHub. Actually, it's my early coding days.
I've picked up interest in coding seeing its numerous potentials.
Recently went through a few weeks of Python class and i would like to go deeper.

I currently reside in Nigeria and work as a field engineer in the Energy sector.
In the bid to learn more and keep busy during the Coronavirus pandemic, i stumbled on coding.
Come with me let's see how far that drive goes.

Cheers!
Bene
